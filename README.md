# Travel and Tourism Management System

The Travel and Tourism Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the management of travel and tourism-related activities. It provides a user-friendly interface for travelers to browse and book travel packages, and for administrators to manage the system's content and bookings. This system has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP and MySQL for the backend.


## Features

- User Registration: Travelers can create an account by providing their personal information, such as name, email, and password.

- User Login: Registered users can log in to access their account and interact with the system.

- Browse and Search Packages: Travelers can browse through various travel packages, view their details, and search for specific packages based on different criteria, such as destination, price range, or duration.

- Booking: Travelers can select a package and book it by providing the required information, such as travel dates, the number of participants, and any special requirements.

- Payment Processing: The system supports secure payment processing to enable travelers to make online payments for their bookings using different payment methods.

- Admin Dashboard: Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage the system's content, such as adding or updating travel packages, managing user accounts, and handling booking requests.

- Booking Management: Administrators can view and manage the bookings made by travelers, including approving or canceling bookings, and generating invoices.
